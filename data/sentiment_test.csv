STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  ,1
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  ,1
"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  ",1
"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  ",1
"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  ",1
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  ,1
"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  ",0

"Both films are terrible, but to the credit of the 1986 version, it was watchable.  ",0
"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  ",0
The script is a big flawed mess.  ,0

"Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie ""Grim"", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  ",0
The movie is terribly boring in places.  ,0
The lighting is awful.  ,0
The film looks cheap and bland.  ,0
One of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore.  ,0
"This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  ",0
The visual effects were AWFUL.  ,0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  ,0

"Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  ",1
"To sum the film up, ""Breeders"" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  ",0
Not recommended.  ,0
"He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  ",0
"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  ",0
"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  ",0
"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  ",0
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,1
"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  ",0
The budget was evidently very limited.  ,0
"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ",0
"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  ",0
Filmiing was less expansive.  ,0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  ,0

Not recommended.  ,0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  ,0

I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  ,0
Which is precisely why I am giving it such a bad review!  ,0
"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ",1
"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  ",1
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,1
"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  ",1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  ,1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  ,1
"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ",0
"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  ",0
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  ,1
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  ,0
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  ,0
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  ,0
"To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  ",0
"In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  ",0
The story line is just awful!  ,0
It's just painful!  ,0
And the accents are absolutely abysmal!  ,0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  ,0
Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film.  ,0
I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  ,1
"The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.  ",1
Go watch it!  ,1
Omit watching this.  ,0
VERY funny!  ,1
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  ,0
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  ,1
"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ",1
Don't miss it.  ,1
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  ",1
"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  ",1
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  ",1
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ",1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ,0
"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  ",0
Avoid at all costs.  ,0
"I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  ",1
I thought Errol Flynn was brilliant as Custer and has since become my favourite actor!  ,1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  ,1
"I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  ",1
But it wasn't until I watched this film that I realised how great he actually was.  ,1
I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  ,1
"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  ",0
"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  ",0
"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ",1
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  ,1
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  ,1
"But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  ",1
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  ,1
There's barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts.  ,1
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  ,1
"Overall, a delight!  ",1
"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  ",0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  ,0
The least said about the acting the better.  ,0
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  ,1
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the Truth and Reconciliation process.  ,1
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  ,1
"The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  ",1
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  ,1
Excellent performance.  ,1
There still are good actors around!  ,1
Also great directing and photography.  ,1
"Very true to Shakespear, and a 'must' for all Shakespear fans.  ",1
"Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  ",1
"Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  ",1
"If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  ",1
"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  ",1
"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  ",1
"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  ",1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  ,1
"Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  ",0
"Unless you're just out to visually ""collect"" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  ",0
"If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  ",1
It is not good.  ,0
"Speaking of the music, it is unbearably predictably and kitchy.  ",0
Then the film just dropped the ball.  ,0
This is a stunning movie.  ,1
Raw and sublimely moving.  ,1
"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  ",1
All of the main players are mesmerising.  ,1
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  ,1
Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  ,1
He's a national treasure.  ,1
GO AND SEE IT!  ,1
This is an excellent film.  ,1
The aerial scenes were well-done.  ,1
It was also the right balance of war and love.  ,1
"The film gives meaning to the phrase, ""Never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.  ",1
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  ,1
A good film by a great director!  ,1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  ,1
"There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene.  ",0
This is just a great movie.  ,1
10 out of 10 stars.  ,1
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  ,0
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  ,0
Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  ,1

DELETE this film from your mind!  ,0
One of the worst shows of all time.  ,0

"The fat computer geek was unbelievable, the bible thumper, the bad-ass girl, who are these actors???  ",0
Never heard of any of them except Cole who was totally unbelievable in the part.  ,0
"Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, ""you see kids..."" Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  ",0
The stories were as unbelievable as the actors.  ,0
Lame would be the best way to describe it.  ,0
"Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  ",1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  ,1
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  ,1
"Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  ",0

"A Lassie movie which should have been ""put to sleep"".... FOREVER.  ",0
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  ,0
"So mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull, uninteresting mess, this is one of the most forgettable movies I've seen.  ",0
"It isn't even an achievement as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" or ""so-bad-it's-memorable"" movie.  ",0
"It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  ",0

Nothing new there.  ,0
That was done in the second movie.  ,0
The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  ,0

I just saw this film and I recommend it.  ,1
"It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  ",1
"A very good film indeed, about great and unconditional love.  ",1
"Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  ",1
"Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  ",1
"Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  ",1
"In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  ",1
"Aailiyah was pretty good as Akasha, in places compelling (her first entrance and mini dance scene).  ",1
"I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  ",1
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  ,1
The football scenes at the end were perplexing.  ,0
But I thought his acting was skilled.  ,1
Meredith M was better than all right.  ,1
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  ,1
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  ,1
Nine out of ten for a truly lovely film.  ,1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  ,1
This is one of the best Italian thrillers of the early 70's.  ,1
A standout scene.  ,1
This scene is very strong and unpleasant.  ,0
"Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  ",1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  ,1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  ,1
I liked the way Dustin Hoffman's character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son.  ,1
This movie is also revealing.  ,1
"Personally, I think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue.  ",1
And it was boring.  ,0
"I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  ",0
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  ,1
"It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  ",1
"An Italian reviewer called this ""a small, great film,"" and that's right.  ",1
"All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  ",1
"You learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie, and a lot about the movie business itself.  ",1
"The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the ""acting coach"" are fascinating.  ",1
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  ,1

Why was this film made?  ,0
The film has an ultra-cheap look to it.  ,0
The result is a film that just don't look right.  ,0

"I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was ""The Stranger"" and I loved it.  ",1
But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR.  ,1
This movie is so awesome!  ,1
"I loved it, it was really scary.  ",1
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  ,1

This is an extraordinary film.  ,1
"As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  ",1
"This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  ",1
"The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  ",1
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  ,1
"Predictable, but not a bad watch.  ",1
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  ,1
She carries the movie well.  ,1
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  ,1
"It is wonderful and inspiring to watch, and I hope that it gets released again on to video or DVD.  ",1
"How this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me: the acting, the story, the characters, the supposedly special effects, etc...it's ALL wrong.  ",0
"In fact, this stinker smells like a direct-to-video release.  ",0
Avoid at ALL costs!  ,0
Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  ,0
"The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  ",0
The attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosen't bear thinking about which basically involves a Vulcan stealing the Enterprise to find god (seriously) I just didn't care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards.  ,0
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  ,0
The worst one of the series.  ,0
Editing: The editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion.  ,1
"When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  ",1
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  ,1
"Of course the footage from the 70s was grainy, but that only enhanced the film.  ",1
This film offers many delights and surprises.  ,1
"When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from ""Don Giovanni"" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  ",1
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  ,1
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  ,1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  ,1
The warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop.  ,1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  ,1
"The acting, as you'd expect from this cast, is top notch.  ",1
"The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  ",1
"Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  ",1
Conclusion - I loved it.  ,1
It's a long time since I was so entertained by a movie.  ,1
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  ,1
"Mark my words, this is one of those cult films like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20, 30, 40 years down the line.  ",1
"It's pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949, as Hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time.  ",1
"The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  ",1
"Plus, with the movie's rather modest budget and fast running time, it does an amazing job!  ",1

"It was that year, however, that reminded us that Huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of James Joyce's acclaimed novella ""The Dead.  ",1
"Feelings, thoughts...Gabriel's discomfort during the dance...all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewer's grasp in Huston's portrayal.  ",1
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  ,0

End of Days is one of the worst big-budget action movies I've ever seen.  ,0
He surely doesn't know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force One who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money.  ,0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  ,0
I'm still trying to get over how bad it was.  ,0
This movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever.  ,1
"It has everything you could want... suspense, drama, comedy, confusing subplots, native americans, brain eating... If you're looking for the be-all, end-all of brainsucking movies, look no further.  ",1
"With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  ",1
"Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever.  ",1
Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle.  ,1
"1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium, melodrama and horrible acting, a mess of a script, and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD, WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  ",0
Lots of holes in the script.  ,0
It's like a bad two hour TV movie.  ,0
Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  ,0
The dialogue is atrocious.  ,0
The acting is beyond abysmal.  ,0
Everything stinks.  ,0
"Trouble is, the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable, like character, story, theme and so on.  ",0
"Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  ",0
"It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  ",0
"In short, don't bother with this movie.  ",0
"I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  ",1
"The best scene in the movie is at the end, but I won't spoil it.  ",1
"If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  ",1
"The result is a powerhouse achievement, made more timely now perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity, and it's distorted interpretations of fame.  ",1
A film not easily forgotten.  ,1
"But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor.  ",1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  ,1
"The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  ",1
"Highly recommended for all ages, although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references, they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular!  ",1
Great movie!  ,1
Also the story and acting were weak.  ,0
"At around 4 pm I bought it, at around 8pm I started to watch, at around 8.15pm I fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain... but there wasn't.  ",0
"Either way, it sucks.  ",0
The script is horrendously stupid.  ,0
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  ,0
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  ,0

You could drive a semi truck into these holes!  ,0
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  ,1
She's poised and amazing.  ,1
Dee Snider just plain sucks.  ,0

I was bored throughout the whole damn thing.  ,0
"The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks.  ",0
This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably.  ,0
This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life.  ,0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  ,0

Avoid this film at all costs.  ,0
"I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  ",0
The only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict.  ,0
Now this is a movie I really dislike.  ,0
It's one of the most boring Horror movies from the 90's mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere.  ,0
"The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  ",0
"The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  ",0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  ,0
"I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  ",0
"The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  ",1
" The best part about Nurse Betty"" is it's unpredictability.  ",1
"Director Neil LaBute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality, and along with the touching drama, and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what is going to happen next.  ",1
"Otherwise, don't even waste your time on this.  ",0
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  ,0
"As for the killer, don't expect anything original or even remotely frightening.  ",0
"There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  ",1
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  ,0
"One of the most boring,pointless movies I have ever seen.  ",0
The secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying.  ,0

This is one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since Speed 2 But not quite that bad.  ,0
"I don't understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store, it's not even a real movie!  ",0
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  ,0

"So I am here to warn you--DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, it is the dumbest thing you have never seen!  ",0
I saw this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely loved it.  ,1
I didn't realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes.  ,1

It was a long time that i didn't see a so charismatic actor on screen.  ,1
Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years.  ,1
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  ,1
I rate this movie 9/10.  ,1
"I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez's directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.  ",1
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  ,1
"Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in ""At Play In The Fields Of The Lord"".  ",1
For readers who have already seen one of Miyazaki's films: he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience.  ,1
"It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  ",1
The two main characters may be two of the most believable children I ever saw put on screen.  ,1
"They are so easy to love, but even more easy to identify with.  ",1

The scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful.  ,1
The story is also both funny and poignant at times.  ,1

This is truly an art movie--it actually has a lot of art in it.  ,1
Go rent it.  ,1
"However, after finally watching this film, I realized that not only had I had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts, I also found myself watching it over and over again.  ",1
"It's the one movie that never ceases to interest me, simply because it keeps me alert, as I try to attempt to decipher it's meanings.  ",1
Brilliance indeed.  ,1

The incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film.  ,1
"Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  ",1
Definitely worth seeing it's the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness.  ,1
"Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, ""Gake No Ue No Ponyo"" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  ",1
"At a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by Disney/Pixar's CGI masterpieces, it is both refreshing and comforting to know that Miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand-drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories.  ",1
Enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film.  ,1
The art style has the appearance of crayon/pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful.  ,1
"If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  ",0
"This one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this one fails everywhere.  ",0
If you haven't choked in your own vomit by the end (by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you've must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time.  ,0
"Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  ",1
"Just consider the excellent story, solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses.  ",1
"Instead, we got a bore fest about a whiny, spoiled brat babysitting.  ",0
"Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  ",1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  ,1
Judith Light is one of my favorite actresses and I think she does a superb job in this film!  ,1
I keep watching it over and over.  ,1
"It's a sad movie, but very good.  ",1
"If you have not seen this movie, I definitely recommend it!  ",1
"She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!  ",1
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  ,1
;) Recommend with confidence!  ,1
This movie is well-balanced with comedy and drama and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  ,1
It was a riot to see Hugo Weaving play a sex-obsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients' houses for his trysts with the flaming Darren (Tom Hollander).  ,1
":) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  ",1
"The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  ",1
Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  ,1
